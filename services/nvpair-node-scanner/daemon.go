//     a cluster, so cluster-uuid= appears in (or disappears from) this node's mDNS
//     record within one refresh interval. This is what lets peers key their pins
//     on us: without the TXT key a peer treats us as unclustered, skips us in its
//     workload broadcast, and drops us as a routing target — while we remain in
//     its roster. It must not depend on a process restart.
//   - Fresh-host startup order: the scanner spawns before cluster-manager, so it
//     mints its own node-id.json and advertises that uuid= before cluster-manager
//     writes identity.json. Once cluster-manager is up (the broker triggers a
//     reload), the re-resolve picks up identity.json so uuid= converges on the
//     cluster principal.

//     addresses track the host's live network instead of freezing at the startup
//     value — matching how the responder keeps its A records live.

// exhaustion. Nothing answering means the node is gone, and no further question
// is worth asking — that is the ordinary departure, and it is settled without
// any HTTP.
//
// Something answering is NOT the end of it, and this is the bug that made a
// wiped node permanent. A connect only proves SOMETHING is listening at an
// address, not that it is the node the record describes. A node whose appdata is
// wiped mints a fresh hostUuid but keeps its LAN address and re-binds the same
// fixed service ports, so the sweep reaches the machine's NEW incarnation and
// reports the OLD record alive. The miss counter is reset on every pass and the

// machine. So when something does answer, we ask the machine who it is
// (identityAlive) and let a definite answer overrule the connect.

// only runs when the node would otherwise have been KEPT, which is exactly when
