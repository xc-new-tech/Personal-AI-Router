// its own addresses from evidence no observer has — which of its interfaces the
// kernel routes off-link, which carry live peers, which ones peers have connected
// to — so IPs keeps that order and IP is simply its head. Collapsing here is what
// left every consumer with a single address and no recourse when it turned out to
// be a link only one other machine could reach.

// freezes at first discovery exactly like a ghost's does. A frozen timestamp
// says nothing about whether the node is alive, and anything willing to wait out

// This is the peer-side counterpart to dropSelf: when a node's appdata is wiped
// it mints a fresh hostUuid, so the fleet sees the same machine arrive as a
// stranger while the pre-wipe record lingers under the old key. dropSelf handles
// that re-stamp for the local node; nothing handled it for peers, so a reset
// node showed up twice everywhere downstream.
//
// A record is nominated — and no more than nominated — when it shares the
// arriving node's Name, carries a different hostUuid, and is at least
// supersedeMinAge older:
//
//   - Same Name. A wipe clears identity but not the hostname.
//   - Older than supersedeMinAge (a filter, not evidence — see above).
//
// A shared address is deliberately NOT part of this. It reads as "one machine"
// only if an address belongs to one machine at a time, and it does not: a
// direct-connect link between two machines uses the same small subnet on every
// such pair, so identically-provisioned hosts genuinely advertise the same
// address on it, and matching there nominated live peers as each other's ghosts.
// Nor is it needed — a wiped machine keeps its hostname whether or not it comes
// back on the same address.
//
// Both remaining signals come from an unauthenticated mDNS record that anything
// on the LAN can claim, so together they describe the SHAPE of a wipe and equally
// the shape of a spoof — and, now that the address is gone, also the shape of two
// hosts that merely share a hostname. daemon.supersedingUpsert must confirm a
// candidate is really gone before deleting it.
//
// The arriving record still needs an address of its own, since that is where the
// confirming read is made — not because matching it against anything would mean
// something.
//
// selfUUID is never nominated, and never nominates: the local record is
// registry-driven rather than browse-driven, and its LastSeen advances only when
// this node republishes, so it must not be displaceable by a peer that happens
// to claim its name.
