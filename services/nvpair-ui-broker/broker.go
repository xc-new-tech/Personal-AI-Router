// last three quarters of it, and no inference traffic from the node in that time
// either, not a transient mDNS miss — so this is a strong
// "the node is really gone" signal. That node's own proxy can no
// longer emit a terminal workload:completed/errored (its process or host is
// gone), so the broker synthesizes a workloads:upsert transition to "failed"
// for each affected workload — clearing the stale "in progress" line while
// keeping the entry in clients' history (we upsert, never remove).
//
// A workload is affected if the departed node is either its origin
// (originatedFrom — the node that submitted it) or its executor (scheduledOn —
// the node that was running it). nodeUUID is the stable per-host UUID; the
// broker stamps that same value as originatedFrom and the proxy records it as
// scheduledOn, so the three correlate directly regardless of a
// hostname change. nodeName is the display hostname, used only in the error
// message. The caller fires this only after the node's final directory claim is
// gone (a surviving manual claim means the node is still present).
//
// The transition is applied as INFERRED (emitWorkloadEventInferred): a guess
// this node made from a discovery miss, not the origin's authoritative truth.
// That provenance is what makes this safe against a wrong guess — the sweep is
// deliberately local (does NOT re-broadcast to peers), and it is reconciled by
// the origin's authoritative re-sync (the workload-manager heartbeat re-asserts
// each node's own active + recently-terminal workloads). So if node B evicts
// node A over a transient partition and infers A's jobs failed, A's next re-sync
// carries its authoritative state and the store's provenance-aware merge
// overrides B's inferred guess — un-sticking it. If A is truly gone, nothing
// overrides the guess and it stands. The origin is the single writer and the
// convergence authority; this sweep only supplies a fast, provisional local
// answer in the gap before the next re-sync. It relies on the scanner's
// eviction being a reasonable "offline" signal — a false positive is corrected,
// not permanent, but until the correcting re-sync arrives (≤ a couple of
