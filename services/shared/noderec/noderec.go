// Package noderec is the single source of truth for the consolidated
// _nvpair-node._tcp wire format and the discovery JSON-RPC contract shared by the
// promoted node-scanner daemon, the broker relay, and every consumer of the
// consolidated discovery.
//
// A node advertises itself as ONE _nvpair-node._tcp record
// whose TXT map carries a schema version, the node's identity, its LAN address,
// and one compact key per local service port, e.g.:
//
//	v=1;uuid=<hostUuid>;cluster-uuid=<clusterUuid>;ip=192.168.1.10;ni=14318;ol=11434;lm=1234;er=14319;wl=14320;cl=14321;em=14322
//
// Design decisions this package encodes:
//   - SRV port is a fixed, NON-authoritative constant; consumers ignore it and
//     read every service port from TXT. A missing service key means that
//     service is absent on that node.
//   - Transport is NOT advertised. A consumer derives a service's transport from
//     the static per-service policy here (service type + whether the target node
//     is clustered), because transport is global policy every same-version
//     binary already knows, not per-instance data.
//   - uuid= (hostUuid) and cluster-uuid= (clusterUuid) are distinct fields:
//     invite resolution keys by hostUuid; the cluster pin is selected by
//     clusterUuid, which is present only when the node is clustered.
//   - The model list is NOT in TXT. It moved to HTTP (engine-manager's em
//     /v1/models) because it can grow past the DNS per-string limit; a peer's
//     daemon fetches it during enrichment and puts it on DirectoryNode.Models.
